# Sales Analysis of a Website with Tableau

# Instructions

In this project, you will be working on the Sales Analysis of a Website project using Tableau.

Data Preparation

•	I imported sales.csv data set.

•	I examined the data set. Tableau displayed the first 1000 rows by default in the data grid. I tried to get a general understanding of what the dataset is about.

•	I understood what a row-level record represents.

•	I changed the workbook locale to the United States. 

•	I identified the data types of all columns and changed any if needed. 

Data Exploration

In this part, I created 17 worksheets. I searched for answers to the following questions. The number at the beginning of each item below represents the sheet number. I  put that number before each sheet name. 

•	1 - Go to Sheet 1 (your workspace) and find how many records the data set has.

•	2 - Find the total number of sellers.

•	3 - What is the total value of sales in EUR?

•	4 - Which brand has the highest number of purchases during the period? Create a horizontal bar chart display. Observe that there are null values. Think about how to deal with the null values. Create a new field named Brand-Updated. Replace null values with Unknown. Change the old Brand field with Brand-Updated.

•	5 - How many items in the “Jewellery” category have no brand associated with them?

•	6 - How many brands have between 35 and 55 transactions (inclusive)? (Suggested Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart)

•	7 - How many pairs of shoes were purchased by Australian (AU) buyers?

•	8 - Which brand has the highest average transaction value? Bring all values in Euros. (Suggested Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart)

•	9 - What is the total value of items purchased by GB buyers from GB sellers?

•	10 - What percentage of US sellers' transactions were purchased by US buyers?

•	11 - Which country made the highest percentage of international purchases?

•	12 - Which day has the highest value of purchases?

•	13 - Which category has 2,324 transactions on 7 August?

•	14 - What percentage of global sales value on 4 August came from US sellers?

•	15 - How many sellers in the US has more than 75 sales?

•	16 - Which seller in the US sold the most in terms of value?

•	17 - Which brand had the largest absolute € difference in average transaction value between domestic and international?
